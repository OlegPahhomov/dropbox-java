# dropbox-java

####### Goal
Creating a simple file upload and viewing platform using different languages and frameworks

####### Java Spark Html project

To run:
* 1) You need Postgres database (or reconfig more in point 2)
* 2) change Appconfig.java and pom.xml database password (default postgres config)
* 3) run mvn flyway:migrate
* 4) start main in Application.java, spark runs on http://localhost:4567/
* 5) if you're not running spark or default port, change serverConfig.js and (I know it sucks) index.html upload form action url



####### In more detail

Backend: java8 - sparkjava - flyway - postgres - apache db utils

Frontend: html - js/jQuery - css - microtemplate.js - fancybox - jquery validation


Known issues.

* Cannot separate into 2 projects. (Front and back end)
It can be run as 2 separate projects, but it has issues:
It will always redirect to default serverside url.
* Front-side validation doesn't work: it submits always.
* Index.html is fat and ugly
